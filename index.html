		<p>Above are my prices for character artwork in my usual style!</p>

		<!-- my rules -->
		<h3>&hercon;I accept commissions of all kinds of characters, including:&hercon;</h3>
			<h4>&checkmark; Humans</h4>
			<h4>&checkmark; Anthros/Furries</h4>
			<h4>&checkmark; Animals</h4>
			<h4>&checkmark; Mechs</h4>
			<p>* Please note, I don't have much experience in animals and mechs, and you order at your own risk</p>
			<p>Payment is half up front, the second half being sent half-way through the piece.</p>
			<h4>&cross; I do not draw anything illegal or immoral, and will turn down commissions as necessary.</h4>

		<h2>Miscellaneous Commissions</h2>
		<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/KZ52M3S.jpeg" alt="Commission info for sketchy style and rp icons" style="width:40%">

		<p> My usual style, as I spend a lot of time and effort on it, can get expensive. But I draw other things as well!</p>
		<h3>Other things I draw include (but are not limited to!):</h3>

		<!-- I describe them one by one here-->
		<h4>&hercon; My sketchy style &hercon;</h4>
		<p>This style is much more rough, and doesn't take advantage of blending out the shading.<br>
		I can finish a piece in about half the time as my usual style, so it costs only half as much! <br>
		Perfect for character designs. </p>

		<h4>&hercon; PMD inspired text RP icons &hercon;</h4>
		<p> Inpsired by Pokemon Mystery Dungeon's way of stylizing character portraits, I make icons for use in <br>
			text rp. Primarily intended for use over discord, you can use a proxy bot such as Tupperbox to set up<br>
			each emotion to appear with a different prefix, allowing your character's image to by dynamic and <br>
			change depending on the situation. No more happy smiles while they're actually crying!
		</p>
		<!-- Text rp icon example in use-->
		<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/V0LhQQh.jpeg" alt="Example of icon use" style="width:25%"></p>

		<h4>&hercon; Emotes &hercon;</h4>
		<p> I can make emotes for Discord, Twitch, or other platforms! All emotes can be used as a base to create new <br>
		ones, so new/unique ones will cost more, while expressions I've drawn before will come at a dicount due to <br>
		less work needing to be done. Ask me to see my full list, or to discuss buying an emote I can't use as a base <br>
		for future commissions.</p>
		<h4>&hercon; Other Styles &hercon;</h4>
		<p>I can draw in a variety of different art styles! Two with price examples are shown above, but I have other <br>
		examples, and can also draw styles you send me, icluding most animes and cartoons. Some, however, like Arcane, <br>
		may be too advanced, so please contact me with a yes or no, and I can let you know if it's possible.</p>
